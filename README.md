# Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to my daily challenges repository! In an effort to push myself and improve my skills, I've committed to solving coding challenges every day. While I'm open to challenges in any programming language, I'm currently focusing on Python as I continue to learn and grow. This repository contains notebooks documenting both the challenges themselves and my approaches to solving them, exclusively in Python.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress as I tackle coding challenges on a daily basis. By documenting my solutions and thought processes, I aim to reinforce my understanding of Python concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Structure:

The repository is structured around two main notebook files:
* **Questions Notebook:** This notebook presents the daily coding challenges I've chosen to tackle. 
* **Approach Notebook:** In this notebook, I detail how I approached and solved each challenge using Python.

## Updates and Contributions

This repository will be regularly updated as I continue my coding challenge journey. While it primarily serves as a personal learning tool, contributions and feedback are welcome.
